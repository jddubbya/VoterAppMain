          information obtained in accordance with the National Voting Rights Act
          of 1993, 52 U.S.C. § 20501, et. seq., and specifically 52 U.S.C. §
          20507(i) and state public records laws. VOCHECK is not the creator or
          originator of the voter information published on VoCheck. All voter
          information on VoCheck is public information provided to VOCHECK by
          state and local election officials. VOCHECK does not represent that
          the voter information provided by state and local election officials
          and displayed on VoCheck is accurate or reliable. Because the voter
          information on VoCheck comes from public records, if you discover any
          problem with the accuracy of information on VoCheck, or if you believe
          for any reason that the voter information should not be contained in
          publicly available records, you should contact the applicable state or
          local election official. YOUR USE OF VOCHECK IS SOLELY AT YOUR OWN
          RISK. VOCHECK MAKES NO REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, OR GUARANTEE OF THE
          SUITABILITY OF VOCHECK OR THAT VOCHECK WILL BE SECURE, UNINTERRUPTED,

          THIRD-PARTY TECHNOLOGY, HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, SYSTEMS, OR DATA. VOCHECK
          IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS, AND ALL
          CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS, AND WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED,
          STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED
          WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
          OR NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE HEREBY DISCLAIMED TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT
          PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. VOCHECK MAY BE SUBJECT TO INTERRUPTION,
          LIMITATIONS, DELAYS, AND OTHER PROBLEMS INHERENT IN THE USE OF
          WIRELESS APPLICATIONS AND ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS, AND VOCHECK IS
          NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY SUCH DELAYS, DELIVERY FAILURES, OR ANY OTHER
          DAMAGE RESULTING FROM EVENTS BEYOND VOCHECK’S REASONABLE CONTROL.
          FURTHER, VOCHECK MAKES NO REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, OR GUARANTEE IN
          REGARD TO ANY INFORMATION DOWNLOADED, OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED BY YOU
          THROUGH VOCHECK FROM A THIRD PARTY. THIS INCLUDES ANY APPLICATION,
          CONTENT, OR LINK PROVIDED BY A THIRD PARTY. YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE
          FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION,

          GOODWILL, DATA, BREACH OF USER SECURITY, TERMINATION OF USER ACCESS,
          OR OTHER PECUNIARY LOSS) ARISING OUT OF THESE TERMS OR THE USE OF OR
          INABILITY TO USE VOCHECK, EVEN IF VOCHECK HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
          POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. YOUR EXCLUSIVE REMEDY AND VOCHECK’S TOTAL
          AGGREGATE LIABILITY RELATING TO, ARISING OUT OF, IN CONNECTION WITH,
          OR INCIDENTAL TO THESE TERMS FOR ANY REASON WILL BE LIMITED TO THE
          ACTUAL DIRECT DAMAGES INCURRED BY YOU, UP TO ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS
          ($100.00). THIS LIMITATION APPLIES TO ALL CAUSES OF ACTION OR CLAIMS
          IN THE AGGREGATE FOR ANY REASON INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
          PERSONAL HARM. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF
