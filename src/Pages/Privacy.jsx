        <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
        <p>
          The purpose of VoCheck.net is to provide public access to official
          government data pertaining to elections, including voter registration
          rolls. VoCheck.net publishes public voter information as provided by
          state and local election officials. This Privacy Policy applies to
          information collected by and through the website and interactive
          services provided by VoCheck.net (the “Services”). This Privacy Policy
          does not apply to information provided by public bodies, such as state
          Secretaries of State and local election authorities. By using any of
          our Services and/or by indicating your assent to this Privacy Policy,
          you agree that this Privacy Policy governs your use of our Services
          and any dispute concerning the Services. Please take a few minutes to
          read the Privacy Policy before using or registering to access our
          Services.
          <h3>Information Collected About You</h3>
          The information VoCheck.net gathers through the Services falls into
          two categories:
          <ol type="1">
            <li>
              information users voluntarily supply when using the Services, and
            </li>
            <li>
              information collected automatically through users use of the
              Services.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h4>1. Information You Provide to Us</h4>
          If you opt-in to VoCheck.net email newsletters or other news alerts,
          VoCheck.net will collect Personal Information about you, such as your
          name, postal address, email address, user name, password, or mobile
          phone number. Depending on the nature of the service, you may be free
          to register for the service without providing this additional
          information. You may provide information to VoCheck.net when you:
          <ol>
            <li>
              Enter registration information for one or more of the Services
            </li>
            <li>Sign up to receive email and/or text message notifications</li>
            <li>Download other information we provide</li>
            <li>Connect with the Services via a social networking site</li>
          </ol>
          VoCheck.net may also collect contact information about other inpiduals
          when you use the sharing and referral tools available within some of
          our Services to forward content to your friends and associates.
          VoCheck.net uses this information to facilitate the communications you
          request. If you use any “send-to-a-friend” features of the Services,
          your email address may be included in the communication sent to your
          friend.
          <h4>
            2.Information Collected Automatically When You Use the Services
          </h4>
          As you use the Services, VoCheck.net and third parties may use

            </li>
            <li>

            <li>
              Your computer and internet connection, including your IP address,
              which can sometimes be used to locate your general geographic
              area, operating system, and browser type;
            </li>
            <li>
              Your device type, screen size, browser type, language and other
              settings, memory capacity, plug-ins, internet domain, TCP
              configuration parameters, operating system, carrier code, time
              zone and the names, versions and package IDs of software installed
              on your device;
            </li>
            <li>

              the links you click on and whether you open or forward a message,
              the date and time of these interactions and the device you use to
              read emails;

            </li>
            <li>Standard server log information; and </li>
            <li>
              Information collected through embedded scripts, cookies, web
              beacons, and other tracking technologies (see additional
              descriptions of these terms below).
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Tracking Technologies</h3>
          VoCheck.net and our service providers or other third parties acting on
          our behalf or with our permission, may use embedded scripts, cookies,
          web beacons, device identifiers and other tracking technologies to
          operate, analyze, and improve our Services and tailor content to user
          interests. Third-party companies that provide some of the tools and
          features accessible through our Services and other websites also may
          use tracking technologies to collect information about your use of our
          Services. A “cookie” is a small text file (often containing a unique
          identifier) that helps us to make your use of our Services more
          enjoyable and meaningful to you. Cookies are accessed and recorded by
          the websites you visit, and by the companies that deliver the
          advertisements you see on our Services, so they can recognize the same
          browser navigating online. Cookies can also help you avoid having to
          log in every time you come back to use the Services. They also allow
          us to tailor a website to better match your interests and preferences.
          There are a couple different types of cookies. A “session” cookie is
          stored only in your computers working memory and lasts only for your
          browsing session. When you close all of your browsers windows, or when
          you shut down your computer, the session cookie disappears forever. A
          “persistent” cookie is stored on your computers hard drive until a
          specified date, which could be tomorrow, next week, or 10 years from
          now. Persistent cookies stay on your computer until they either, a)
          expire; b) are overwritten with newer cookies; or c) you manually
          remove them. Most browsers can be configured not to accept cookies.
          This may, however, prevent you from having access to some site
          functions or features. Your browser can also notify you when a cookie
          is set. (Check the “Help” menu of your browser to learn how to change
          your cookie preferences.) Please be aware that certain browsers cannot
          block or delete so-called “Flash” cookies, which use a feature of the
          Adobe Flash video player to store information on your computer. For
          information about how to delete Flash cookies, please visit the Adobe
          website here. The Services may use spotlight ads/web beacons/GIF/pixel
          tags, which are site instrumentation tools that help us to determine,
          for instance, whether a page has been viewed or not; and if so, how
          many times. In general, any electronic image viewed as part of a
          webpage, can act as a web beacon, which is a small string of code that
          embeds a small graphic image (usually invisible) on a web page or in
          an email. When your browser downloads a web beacon, the server that
          sends the corresponding image to your browser can recognize and store
          certain types of information such as cookies previously set, the time
          and date that you viewed the page embedded with the beacon and a
          description of that page.
          <h4>Mobile Device IDs and Location-Based Information</h4>
          When you use a mobile device to access the Services, VoCheck.net may
          collect different types of information about your location, including
          general information (e.g., IP address, zip code) and more specific
          information (e.g., GPS-based location information). VoCheck.net may
          use that information to customize the Services with location-based
          information and features. For example, if your IP address indicates an
          origin in Reno, the Services may be customized with Reno-specific
          information. In order to do this, your location information may be
          shared with our agents or vendors. If you access the Services through
          a mobile device and you do not want your device to automatically
          provide us with location-tracking information, you can disable the GPS
          or other location-tracking functions on your device, provided your
          device allows you to do this. See your device manufacturers
          instructions for further details. We may still ask for a zip code or
          other location information.
          <h4>Social Network Posting Tools and “Share” Features</h4>
          VoCheck.net may offer social network posting and sharing tools through
          the Services, including a “share” button that allows you to post links
          to content and features that you believe will be of interest to others
          on your social network pages. Those tools are operated by third
          parties. When you use one of those sharing tools, the third-party
          company that operates the tool may be collecting information about
          your browser, device, and online activity through its own tracking
          technologies and subject to its own, separate privacy policy.
          <h3>How We Use the Information We Collect</h3>
          VoCheck.net will not use information that we collect about you or that
          you provide to us for commercial purposes. VoCheck.net might use

            </li>

              message or other media;

              In any other way we may describe when you provide the information.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h3>How We Share and Disclose Information</h3>
          Except as otherwise expressly noted herein or within the Services,
          VoCheck.net may share information collected with entities affiliated
          with the Voter Reference Foundation, but those entities will
          explicitly abide by all use restrictions and will use said information
          only for administration and operation of VoCheck.net itself. Here are
          some of the circumstances in which VoCheck.net may share information
          about our users:
          <h4>Service Providers</h4>
          In addition, VoCheck.net may share any information collected through
          the Services with our service providers. We may offer some features
          (such as social sharing tools) in conjunction with service providers
          that specialize in operating such services. We share with each of
          these service providers such information as is useful or necessary to
          provide you with the services we offer through that service provider.
          The service providers that have access to personally identifiable
          information are required to protect this information in a manner that
          is consistent with this Privacy Policy, for example, by not using the
          information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they
          are performing for VoCheck.net.
          <h4>Aggregated and Anonymous Information</h4>
          Our service providers may render information anonymous by removing any
          information (such as your name) that makes the information personally
          identifying to you. Our service providers may combine information
          about you with information that we or they collect about other users
          of our Services or other web services and share it in a form that does
          not identify you personally. Our service providers may use such
          aggregated information or other anonymous information and disclose it
          to third parties for any purpose.
          <h4>Legal Uses</h4>
          We may disclose your Personal Information to comply with any court
          order, law, or legal process, including in response to any government
          or regulatory request; to enforce or apply our terms of use and other
          agreements, including for billing and collection purposes; or if we
          believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect the rights,
          property, or safety of VoCheck.net, our users, or others.
          <h4>Transfers Between Entities</h4>
          We may disclose any information we collect to successor in the event
          of a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution
          or other sale or transfer of some or all of VoCheck.nets assets,
          whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or
          similar proceeding, in which Personal Information held by VoCheck.net
          about users of our Services is among the assets transferred. We may
          also disclose any information we collect to other companies that are
          affiliated with VoCheck.
          <h3>Your Opt-Out Choices</h3>
          <h4>Email</h4>
          If you want to opt out from a VoCheck.net email newsletter or other
          email list, use the unsubscribe link at the bottom of each message or
          send us an email at TBD with the email address at which you no longer
          wish to receive newsletters or other emails.If you want to disable web
          beacons in our email messages, turn images “off” in your email system
          (e.g., Outlook or Outlook Express). Check the settings or options menu
          in your email system for more information.
          <h4>Precise Device Location Tracking</h4>
          If you agreed to allow VoCheck.net and/or our service providers to
          collect and/or share information about the precise location of your
          device by tracking a mobile application, you can withdraw your
          permission by accessing and changing your device’s location privacy
          settings. This will prevent further collection of your precise device
          location information. Each operating system, iOS for Apple devices,
          and Android for Android devices, provides its own instructions on how
          to turn off precise location sharing. Access the privacy settings for
          your mobile device or contact your platform operator for more
          information.
          <h3>Information Security</h3>
          We have implemented reasonable administrative, technical, and physical
          security measures to protect against unauthorized access, destruction,
          or alteration of your information. No security system is impenetrable,
          however, we cannot guarantee the security of our databases, nor can we
          guarantee that information you supply won’t be intercepted while being
          transmitted to us over the internet or that information we collect
          will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this
          Privacy Policy.
          <h3>Correcting or Updating Your Information</h3>
          You may update or access and edit certain personally identifying
          information that you have provided to us through our Services. To
          update this information, please send us an email at TBD
          <h3>Links to Other Sites</h3>
          VoCheck.net sites and applications provide links that link to other
          websites. We encourage you to review the privacy statements of all
          sites that you visit, including those whose links are provided, so
          that you can understand how those sites collect, use, and share your
          information. VoCheck.net is not responsible for the privacy
          statements, content, or data handling practices on other websites.
          <h3>International Data</h3>
          The Services are hosted in the United States. United States law
          governs the Services, and United States data protection laws may not
          be as protective as those in your country. If you are outside the
          United States or are not a United States citizen, you should not use
          the Services. User information will be transferred to, stored, and
          processed in the United States where our servers are located and our
          databases are operated, and you consent to the use and storage of your
          information in the United States.
          <h3>Children Under 13</h3>
          The Services are not intended for children under 13 years of age, and
          VoCheck.net does not knowingly collect information from children under
          13. If you are under the age of 13, do not: use, or provide any
          information on, the Services; use any of the interactive or public
          comment features of the Services; or otherwise provide any information
          about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number,
          email address or any screen name or user name you may use. If we learn
          we have collected or received Personal Information from a child under
          13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that
          information. If you believe we might have any Personal Information
          from or about a child under 13, please contact us at TBD.
          <h3>Changes to Our Privacy Policy</h3>
          VoCheck.net reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at any
          time to reflect changes in the law, our data collection and use
          practices, the features of our Services, or advances in technology. If
          we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we’ll post the changes here
          and indicate at the top of the Privacy Policy the last date on which
          it was updated. Please check the Privacy Policy periodically for
          changes. Your continued use of the Services following the posting of
          changes to this Privacy Policy will mean you accept those changes.
