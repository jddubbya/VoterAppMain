    INTRODUCTION
  </h3>
    <p>
      The purpose of VoCheck.net is to provide public access to official government data pertaining to elections, 
      including voter registration rolls. VoCheck.net publishes public voter information as provided by state and 
      local election officials. This Privacy Policy applies to information collected by and through the website and
      interactive services provided by VoCheck.net (the “Services”). This Privacy Policy does not apply to information 
      provided by public bodies, such as state Secretaries of State and local election authorities. By using any of our 
      Services and/or by indicating your assent to this Privacy Policy, you agree that this Privacy Policy governs your 
      use of our Services and any dispute concerning the Services. Please take a few minutes to read the Privacy Policy 
      before using or registering to access our Services.
    <h3>Information Collected About You</h3>
      The information VoCheck.net gathers through the Services falls into two categories: 
      <ol type="1">
      <li>information users voluntarily supply when using the Services, and</li>
      <li>information collected automatically through users use of the Services.</li>
      </ol>
    <h4>1. Information You Provide to Us</h4> 
      If you opt-in to VoCheck.net email newsletters or other news alerts, VoCheck.net will collect Personal Information 
      about you, such as your name, postal address, email address, user name, password, or mobile phone number. Depending 
      on the nature of the service, you may be free to register for the service without providing this additional information.
      You may provide information to VoCheck.net when you:
      <ol>
        <li>Enter registration information for one or more of the Services</li>
        <li>Sign up to receive email and/or text message notifications</li>
        <li>Download other information we provide</li>
        <li>Connect with the Services via a social networking site</li>
      </ol>
      VoCheck.net may also collect contact information about other inpiduals when you use the sharing and referral tools 
      available within some of our Services to forward content to your friends and associates. VoCheck.net uses this information 
      to facilitate the communications you request. If you use any “send-to-a-friend” features of the Services, your email 
      address may be included in the communication sent to your friend.
      <h4>2.Information Collected Automatically When You Use the Services</h4>
      As you use the Services, VoCheck.net and third parties may use automatic data collection technologies to collect data about 
      your equipment and browsing, including information about:
      <ol>
        <li>Your use of the Services, including traffic data, location data, logs, and other communication data and the resources 
          that you access and use within the Services;</li>
        <li>Your online activities over time and across third-party websites or other online services (behavioral tracking);</li>
        <li>Your computer and internet connection, including your IP address, which can sometimes be used to locate your general 
          geographic area, operating system, and browser type;</li>
        <li>Your device type, screen size, browser type, language and other settings, memory capacity, plug-ins, internet domain, 
          TCP configuration parameters, operating system, carrier code, time zone and the names, versions and package IDs of software 
          installed on your device;</li>
        <li>Your interactions with email messages from VoCheck.net, such as the links you click on and whether you open or forward a 
          message, the date and time of these interactions and the device you use to read emails;</li>
        <li>The sites you visited before and after you visited a VoCheck.net website</li>
        <li>Search terms you enter using the Services or on a referral site;</li>
        <li>Unique identifiers, including mobile device identification numbers, that can identify the physical location of devices 
          in accordance with applicable law;</li>
        <li>Standard server log information; and </li>
        <li>Information collected through embedded scripts, cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies (see additional 
          descriptions of these terms below).</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Tracking Technologies</h3> 
        VoCheck.net and our service providers or other third parties acting on our behalf or with our permission, may use 
        embedded scripts, cookies, web beacons, device identifiers and other tracking technologies to operate, analyze, 
        and improve our Services and tailor content to user interests. Third-party companies that provide some of the 
        tools and features accessible through our Services and other websites also may use tracking technologies to 
        collect information about your use of our Services. A “cookie” is a small text file (often containing a unique 
        identifier) that helps us to make your use of our Services more enjoyable and meaningful to you. Cookies are 
        accessed and recorded by the websites you visit, and by the companies that deliver the advertisements you see 
        on our Services, so they can recognize the same browser navigating online. Cookies can also help you avoid having 
        to log in every time you come back to use the Services. They also allow us to tailor a website to better match 
        your interests and preferences. There are a couple different types of cookies. A “session” cookie is stored only 
        in your computers working memory and lasts only for your browsing session. When you close all of your browsers 
        windows, or when you shut down your computer, the session cookie disappears forever. A “persistent” cookie is 
        stored on your computers hard drive until a specified date, which could be tomorrow, next week, or 10 years from 
        now. Persistent cookies stay on your computer until they either, a) expire; b) are overwritten with newer cookies; 
        or c) you manually remove them. Most browsers can be configured not to accept cookies. This may, however, prevent 
        you from having access to some site functions or features. Your browser can also notify you when a cookie is set. 
        (Check the “Help” menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.) Please be aware that 
        certain browsers cannot block or delete so-called “Flash” cookies, which use a feature of the Adobe Flash video 
        player to store information on your computer. For information about how to delete Flash cookies, please visit the 
        Adobe website here. The Services may use spotlight ads/web beacons/GIF/pixel tags, which are site instrumentation 
        tools that help us to determine, for instance, whether a page has been viewed or not; and if so, how many times. 
        In general, any electronic image viewed as part of a webpage, can act as a web beacon, which is a small string of 
        code that embeds a small graphic image (usually invisible) on a web page or in an email. When your browser downloads 
        a web beacon, the server that sends the corresponding image to your browser can recognize and store certain types of 
        information such as cookies previously set, the time and date that you viewed the page embedded with the beacon and 
        a description of that page.
      <h4>Mobile Device IDs and Location-Based Information</h4>
        When you use a mobile device to access the Services, VoCheck.net may collect different types of information about 
        your location, including general information (e.g., IP address, zip code) and more specific information 
        (e.g., GPS-based location information). VoCheck.net may use that information to customize the Services with 
        location-based information and features. For example, if your IP address indicates an origin in Reno, the Services 
        may be customized with Reno-specific information. In order to do this, your location information may be shared with 
        our agents or vendors. If you access the Services through a mobile device and you do not want your device to 
        automatically provide us with location-tracking information, you can disable the GPS or other location-tracking 
        functions on your device, provided your device allows you to do this. See your device manufacturers instructions 
        for further details. We may still ask for a zip code or other location information.
      <h4>Social Network Posting Tools and “Share” Features</h4>
        VoCheck.net may offer social network posting and sharing tools through the Services, including a “share” button 
        that allows you to post links to content and features that you believe will be of interest to others on your social 
        network pages. Those tools are operated by third parties. When you use one of those sharing tools, the third-party 
        company that operates the tool may be collecting information about your browser, device, and online activity through 
        its own tracking technologies and subject to its own, separate privacy policy.
      <h3>How We Use the Information We Collect</h3>
        VoCheck.net will not use information that we collect about you or that you provide to us for commercial purposes.

        ways:
        <ol>
        <li>To present our Services and their contents to you;</li>

        <li>To perform analytics and research aimed at improving the accuracy, effectiveness, usability, or popularity of the Services; and</li>
        <li>In any other way we may describe when you provide the information.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>How We Share and Disclose Information</h3>
      Except as otherwise expressly noted herein or within the Services, VoCheck.net may share information collected 
      with entities affiliated with the Voter Reference Foundation, but those entities will explicitly abide by all 
      use restrictions and will use said information only for administration and operation of VoCheck.net itself. 
      Here are some of the circumstances in which VoCheck.net may share information about our users:
      <h4>Service Providers</h4>
        In addition, VoCheck.net may share any information collected through the Services with our service providers. 
        We may offer some features (such as social sharing tools) in conjunction with service providers that specialize 
        in operating such services. We share with each of these service providers such information as is useful or 
        necessary to provide you with the services we offer through that service provider. The service providers that 
        have access to personally identifiable information are required to protect this information in a manner that is 
        consistent with this Privacy Policy, for example, by not using the information for any purpose other than to 
        carry out the services they are performing for VoCheck.net.
      <h4>Aggregated and Anonymous Information</h4>
        Our service providers may render information anonymous by removing any information (such as your name) that 
        makes the information personally identifying to you. Our service providers may combine information about you 
        with information that we or they collect about other users of our Services or other web services and share it 
        in a form that does not identify you personally. Our service providers may use such aggregated information or 
        other anonymous information and disclose it to third parties for any purpose.
      <h4>Legal Uses</h4>
        We may disclose your Personal Information to comply with any court order, law, or legal process, including in 
        response to any government or regulatory request; to enforce or apply our terms of use and other agreements, 
        including for billing and collection purposes; or if we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to 
        protect the rights, property, or safety of VoCheck.net, our users, or others.
      <h4>Transfers Between Entities</h4>
        We may disclose any information we collect to successor in the event of a merger, divestiture, restructuring, 
        reorganization, dissolution or other sale or transfer of some or all of VoCheck.nets assets, whether as a going 
        concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding, in which Personal Information held by 
        VoCheck.net about users of our Services is among the assets transferred. We may also disclose any information 
        we collect to other companies that are affiliated with VoCheck.
      <h3>Your Opt-Out Choices</h3>
      <h4>Email</h4>
        If you want to opt out from a VoCheck.net email newsletter or other email list, use the unsubscribe link at the 
        bottom of each message or send us an email at TBD with the email address at which you no longer wish to receive 
        newsletters or other emails.If you want to disable web beacons in our email messages, turn images “off” in your 
        email system (e.g., Outlook or Outlook Express). Check the settings or options menu in your email system for more 
        information.
      <h4>Precise Device Location Tracking</h4>
        If you agreed to allow VoCheck.net and/or our service providers to collect and/or share information about the 
        precise location of your device by tracking a mobile application, you can withdraw your permission by accessing 
        and changing your device’s location privacy settings.  This will prevent further collection of your precise 
        device location information. Each operating system, iOS for Apple devices, and Android for Android devices, 
        provides its own instructions on how to turn off precise location sharing. Access the privacy settings for your 
        mobile device or contact your platform operator for more information.
      <h3>Information Security</h3>
        We have implemented reasonable administrative, technical, and physical security measures to protect against 
        unauthorized access, destruction, or alteration of your information. No security system is impenetrable, however, 
        we cannot guarantee the security of our databases, nor can we guarantee that information you supply won’t be 
        intercepted while being transmitted to us over the internet or that information we collect will never be 
        disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.
      <h3>Correcting or Updating Your Information</h3>
        You may update or access and edit certain personally identifying information that you have provided to us through 
        our Services. To update this information, please send us an email at TBD
      <h3>Links to Other Sites</h3>
        VoCheck.net sites and applications provide links that link to other websites. We encourage you to review the 
        privacy statements of all sites that you visit, including those whose links are provided, so that you can 
        understand how those sites collect, use, and share your information. VoCheck.net is not responsible for the 
        privacy statements, content, or data handling practices on other websites.
      <h3>International Data</h3>

      protection laws may not be as protective as those in your country. If you are outside the United States or are not 
      a United States citizen, you should not use the Services. User information will be transferred to, stored, and 
      processed in the United States where our servers are located and our databases are operated, and you consent to

        name or user name you may use. If we learn we have collected or received Personal Information from a child 
        under 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information. If you believe we might 
        have any Personal Information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at TBD.

        VoCheck.net reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time to reflect changes in the law, our 
        data collection and use practices, the features of our Services, or advances in technology. If we decide to 
        change our Privacy Policy, we’ll post the changes here and indicate at the top of the Privacy Policy the last 
        date on which it was updated. Please check the Privacy Policy periodically for changes. Your continued use of 
        the Services following the posting of changes to this Privacy Policy will mean you accept those changes.
